# Privacy & Security

**Click. Speak. Fix.**

Your privacy matters. Here's exactly how ClickSay handles your data.

---

## Your Data Stays in Your Browser

ClickSay stores all capture data, history, and settings **locally in your browser**. Your data is never uploaded to external servers.

- **Element captures** - stored locally
- **Voice transcriptions** - processed locally by your browser
- **Screenshots** - stored locally
- **History** - stored locally
- **Settings and preferences** - stored locally

---

## Voice Processing

ClickSay uses your browser's **built-in Speech API** for voice feedback. Speech recognition is handled by the browser itself - ClickSay does not send audio to any third-party service.

---

## Screenshots

Screenshots are captured and stored **entirely within your browser**. They are never uploaded or transmitted anywhere.

---

## License Validation

The only network request ClickSay makes is during **Pro license validation**. When you validate your license key:

- Only the **license key itself** is sent to our server
- No capture data, voice data, screenshots, or browsing history is transmitted
- The validation confirms your Pro status and nothing more

---

## No Analytics or Tracking

ClickSay does **not** include any analytics, telemetry, or tracking in the extension. We don't track:

- What pages you visit
- What elements you capture
- What feedback you speak
- How often you use the extension

---

## Clearing Your Data

You can delete all your ClickSay data at any time:

1. Open the ClickSay side panel (click the icon in your toolbar)
2. Use the **history controls** to purge your capture history
3. All locally stored data will be removed
